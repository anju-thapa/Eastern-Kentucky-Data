# Eastern Kentucky Data Analysis: Water Level and Sensor Data

## Introduction
This repository contains data and analysis related to water level measurements from sensors installed in Eastern Kentucky. The primary objective of this project is to analyze the water level data to identify patterns and insights that can assist in water resource management and decision-making processes.

## Data Description
The data in this repository consists of water level measurements collected from various sensors located in Eastern Kentucky. The data is organized into raw, cleaned, and processed formats, allowing for streamlined analysis and visualization.

### Folder Structure
- **raw_data/**: Contains raw, unprocessed sensor data collected directly from the level sender.
- **cleaned_data/**: Includes processed data after cleaning and filtering to remove inconsistencies or errors from the level sender.
- **scripts/**: MATLAB scripts used for data processing, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Eastern_Kentucky_Data/**: Contains data collected from various sensors related to the project.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your system.
- Required MATLAB toolboxes for data analysis and visualization.

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anju-thapa/Eastern-Kentucky-Data.git
   cd Eastern-Kentucky-Data
   ```
2. Open the MATLAB script from the **scripts/** folder.
3. Modify the file paths as needed to match your system.
4. Run the script to generate visualizations and data summaries.

## Results
Results and visualizations generated from the data analysis are stored in the appropriate folders. You can also find plots and graphs summarizing water level trends, anomalies, and sensor performance metrics.

## Future Work
- Improve data cleaning techniques by implementing more robust data validation and flagging processes.
- Develop predictive models to forecast water level changes based on historical data and real-time inputs.
- Automate data collection and integrate real-time monitoring capabilities.
